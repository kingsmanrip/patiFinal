- `timesheetService.js`: Manages timesheet entries and calculations

## Testing

The application includes several types of tests:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests for the services using Jest:

```
npm test
```

Key test files:
- `src/services/__tests__/userService.test.js`: Tests for user authentication and management
- `src/services/__tests__/timesheetService.test.js`: Tests for timesheet calculations and management

### Component Tests

Tests for key UI components:

- `src/components/__tests__/PainterTimesheet.test.js`: Tests for the timesheet entry form
- `src/components/__tests__/UserManagement.test.js`: Tests for the user management interface

### Manual End-to-End Tests

A comprehensive set of manual test scenarios is available in `E2E_TESTS.md`. These tests cover:

- User login and authentication
- User management
- Timesheet entry with different break scenarios
- Admin dashboard functionality
- Data persistence

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with the following schema:

### Users Table
- `id` (TEXT, Primary Key): Unique user identifier
- `username` (TEXT): User's login name
- `password` (TEXT): User's password (stored in plaintext for simplicity)
- `role` (TEXT): User role ('admin' or 'user')
- `hourlyRate` (REAL): Hourly rate for payment calculation

### Timesheets Table
- `id` (TEXT, Primary Key): Unique timesheet entry identifier
- `userId` (TEXT): Foreign key to users table
- `date` (TEXT): Date of work
- `startTime` (TEXT): Start time of work
- `endTime` (TEXT): End time of work
- `breakStart` (TEXT): Start time of break (optional)
- `breakEnd` (TEXT): End time of break (optional)
- `notes` (TEXT): Additional notes (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Reset Users

If you encounter issues with user data, you can reset all users to just the admin account:

1. Login as admin
2. Go to the User Management tab
